# TankticsGame2022
This project is implemented on Unity 2020 C#. The project is implemented on the principle of classic tanks. There are two teams. One of the teams contains a unit controlled by the user. You need to get to the flag of the blue team and hit it with a shot. The game also provides a map editor, where the user can create, delete and edit locations.
